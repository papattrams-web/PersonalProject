## Project Description
Geekerz is a platform designed to bring people together through gaming, no matter what device they use. It gives everyone the chance to play iMessage-style multiplayer games without needing an iPhone, breaking down the barriers that usually keep friends apart.

A major problem with current messaging games is that they lack a unified structure for larger groups. Geekerz solves this by introducing group tournaments—a key feature missing from iMessage—allowing users to join scheduled competitions, win prizes, and track their stats on public leaderboards. By putting everything in one place, it makes it easier to run fair tournaments and helps build a more active, inclusive gaming community for everyone.
