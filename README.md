## Project Description
Geekerz is a platform designed to centralize gaming activities within the Ashesi community, allowing students to participate in tournaments, compete for prizes, and track their performance on public leaderboards. Users can join scheduled competitions or play individual logic-based games such as 2048 and Sudoku, with their scores automatically updated on the leaderboard. This system solves the current problem where gaming tournaments are usually organized informally within friend groups and lack a unified structure. By bringing everything into one accessible platform, it helps create a more vibrant gaming culture on campus, encourages healthy competition, and makes it easier for organizers to run fair and transparent tournaments.
